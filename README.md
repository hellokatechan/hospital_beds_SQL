### Business Needs 

TLDR: Using SQL to identify which hospital sites are suitable to launch its first intervention pilot program. 

Leadership wants to launch an intervention to hire more nurses in the hospital network, for hospitals with ICUs and Surgical Intensive Care(SICU), to better care for cirtical patients who are admitted to these facilites. Studies show that higher nurse to patient ratios lead to better outcomes in these intensive care settings. 

For this first intervention pilot program, the data analyst will need to identify hospital sites that have sufficient volumn of ICU and SICU beds as defined by three types of beds: license beds, census beds, and staffed beds.
